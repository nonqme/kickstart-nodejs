# Kickstart Node.js

🚧 Work in Progress 🚧

Welcome to **Kickstart Node.js**! This repository is a collection of templates to quickly start new Node.js projects.

## What's Planned?

Here’s what you’ll find in this repository:

1. **Node.js with TypeScript**  
   A boilerplate for projects that require type safety and scalability using TypeScript.

2. **Node.js with JavaScript**  
   A straightforward template for projects using plain JavaScript.

3. **CLI (Command-Line Interface)**  
   A starting point for building CLI tools with Node.js.

4. **Plugin Development**  
   A template for creating Node.js plugins.

## Notes 📝

- Each template includes a dedicated README with setup instructions.
- The goal is to keep these templates up to date and aligned with modern development practices.
- A CLI tool is in development to help generate these templates easily.
